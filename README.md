# Courtois NeuroMod documentation

A central repository for important documentation of the Courtois NeuroMod project.
The most recent version of the doc is published [here](http://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/).

The docs are built with sphinx. Content is mostly composed of markdown files (with a few .rst) located in `source`, and  
the website is located in `build`. To update the website, install the dependencies (python3) using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then type
```
make html
```
