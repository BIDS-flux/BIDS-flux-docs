# Physiology
During fMRI and MEG scans electrophysiological signals were recorded using a Biopac M160  MRI compatible systems and amplifiers. Measurements were acquired at 1000 Hz. Recodings were synch to the scans via the TTL pulse. All measurements were recorded and monitored using Biopac's Acknowledge sofware. 

## Plethysmograph
 Participant’s pulse was measured using a MR-compatible plethysmograph.  A Biopac TSD200-MRI photoplethysmogram transducer was  placed on the foot or toe of the participants to obtain beat-by-beat estimates of heart rate.

## Skin conductance
Skin conductance, was measured using two electrodes, one applied to the sole of the foot and the othet to ankle, to record their electrodermal response.

## Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG) was used to  measure the electrical activity generated by the heart. The ECG was recorded using three MR-compatible electrodes that were placed adjacent to one aother, on the lower left rib cage, just under the heart.

## Respiration
Participant’s respiration is measured using a custom MRI compatible respiration belt.  The respiration system consists of: a pressure cuff  taken from a blood pressure monitor (PhysioLogic blood), a pressure sensor (MPXV5004GC7U, NXP USA Inc), and flexible tubing. The cuff is attached to the participant’s upper abdomen using Velcro strap, and connected to the pressure sensor, located outside the scanner room, using tubing passed through the waveguide.  The pressure signal is recorded using an analog input on the BIOPAC system, and monitored using Acknowledged software.
