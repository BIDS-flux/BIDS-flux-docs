# Physiology
During fMRI and MEG scans electrophysiological signals were recorded using a Biopac M160  MRI compatible systems and amplifiers. Measurements were acquired at 1000 Hz. Recodings were synch to the scans via the TTL pulse. 

## Plethysmograph
 Participantâ€™s pulse was measured using a MR-compatible plethysmograph.  A Biopac TSD200-MRI photoplethysmogram transducer was  placed on the foot or toe of the participants to obtain beat-by-beat estimates of heart rate.

## Skin conductance
Skin conductance, was measured using two electrodes applied to the sole of the foot to record their electrodermal response.

## Electrocardiogram
An electrocardiogram (ECG) was used to  measure the electrical activity generated by the heart. The ECG was recorded using three MR-compatible electrodes that were placed on the left lower left rib cage, just under the heart.

## Respiration
Respiration was measured using an in-house MRI compatible respiration belt, with a pressure transducer and plugged in to the Biopac system.
