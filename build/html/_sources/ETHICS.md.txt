# Ethics

the core NeuroMod team is based at the Research Centre of the Montreal Geriatric Institute ([CRIUGM](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/en.html)). The CRIUGM is part of a large governmental health organization,  in one of the CIUSSS center, the [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'île-de-Montréal](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/propos/services-en-anglais). The Courtois NeuroMod project has been approved by the institutional research ethics board of the CIUSSS. The associated documentation may be useful for research teams using NeuroMod data, and are required by their institutions to receive approval by their local ethics review board for secondary analysis.
