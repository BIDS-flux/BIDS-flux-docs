# MRI

<img src="./_static/mri/mri.jpg" alt="UNF MRI" width="350" align="right" hspace="10"/> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the Courtois neuromod project is being acquired at the functional neuroimaging unit ([UNF](https://unf-montreal.ca/)), located at the "Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal" ([CRIUGM](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/)) and affiliated with [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) as well as the [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'île-de-Montréal](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/propos/services-en-anglais). The scanner is a Siemens Prisma Fit, with a 64 channels head coil. Most imaging in the Courtois Neuromod project are composed solely of functional MRI runs. Periodically, an entire session is dedicated to anatomical scans. The scanning environment includes a number of stimulation and response equipment, detailed below.   

## Personalized head cases
<img src="./_static/mri/headcase.png" alt="head case" width="200" align="right" hspace="10"/> In order to minimize movement during neuroimaging scans, each participant wears a custom-designed, personalized headcase built by a company called [Caseforge](https://caseforge.co) during scanning. The headcase are milled based on a scan of each participant's head generated using a handheld 3D scanner, as well as the shape of the MRI coil. Caseforge  mills the personalized headcases in polystyrene foam blocks.

## Stimuli

### Visual presentation

All visual stimuli were presented with a projector onto a blank screen located in the MRI room, through a waveguide.

### Auditory system

For functional sessions, participant wore MRI compatible  S15 [Sensimetric] (http://www.sens.com/products/model-s15/) headphone inserts, proving high-quality acoustic stimulation and substantial attenuation of background noise.  On the computer used for stimuli presentation, a custom impulse response of the headphones is applied with an online finite impulse response filter using the LADSPA DSP to all the presented stimuli.This impulse response was provided by the manufacturer. Sounds was amplified using an [AudioSource] (http://audiosource.net/shop/amp100vs/) AMP100V amplifier, situated in the control room.

### Stimuli presentation

For the HCP-trt dataset, Eprime scripts provided by the Human Connectome project were adapted for our presentation system, and run using Eprime 2.0. For all other tasks, a custom overlay on top of Psychopy was used to present the different tasks and synchronize task with the scanner TTL.
This software also allowed to trigger the start of the eyetracking system, and onset the stimuli presentation. TTL pulses were also recorded in the [ACQKNOWLEDGE software](https://www.biopac.com/wp-content/uploads/AcqKnowledge-Specialized.pdf). All task stimuli scripts are available through [github](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/task_stimuli).

## Functional acquisitions

 Note that the parameters of the functional MRI sequence relevant for data analysis can be found in the [BIDS dataset](https://git.unf-montreal.ca/neuromod/), and included metadata. The functional acquisition parameters are all identical to the one used in the HCP-trt dataset. The Siemens exam card can be found [here](./_static/mri/functional_protocol_HCP-trt.pdf), and is briefly recapitulated below. Functional MRI data was acquired using an accelerated simultaneous multi-slice , gradient echo-planar imaging sequence [(Xu et al., 2013)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23899722) developed at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) University of Minnesota, as part of the Human Connectome Project [(Glasser et al., 2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4361). The sequence is available on the Siemens PRISMA scanner at UNF through a concept to production (C2P) agreement, and was used with the following paramaters: slice acceleration factor of 4, TR = 1.49 s, TE = 37 ms, flip angle = 52 degrees, voxel size = 2 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm, 60 slices, acquisition matrix 96x96. In each session, a short acquisition (3 volumes) with reversed phase encoding direction was acquired to allow retrospective correction of B0 field inhomogeneity-induced distortion.

## Anatomical acquisitions

The Siemens pdf exam card of the anatomical sessions can be found [here](./_static/mri/anatomical_protocol_2019-01-22.pdf), and is briefly recaped below. Note that the parameters of the MRI sequences relevant for data analysis can be found in the BIDS dataset and included metadata.
