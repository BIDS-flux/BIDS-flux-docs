Courtois NeuroMod documentation
=============

The Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod) aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour. NeuroMod replicates classic supervised learning tasks, such as image classification or video game play, as well as an extensive repertoire of videos. Brain activity and body physiology are recorded using state-of-the-art neuroimaging technology (functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography) and sensors (including electrodermal activity and occulometry). The samples of human brain activity will be used as a functional annotation to train DNNs, with the goal to reach excellent performance across a range of tasks drawn from different cognitive domains. All data collected by Courtois NeuroMod are freely shared with the scientific community to advance research on neuro-AI, and this repository contains all the documentation pertaining to the project.

.. note:: This site is under construction. The first release of Courtois NeuroMod data is scheduled for June 2020. Thank you for your patience!
