<p>This <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cneuromod</span></code> dataset is called HCP test-retest (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hcptrt</span></code>), because participants repeated 15 times the functional localizers developed by the Human Connectome Project, for a total of approximately 10 hours of functional data per subject. The protocol consisted of seven tasks, described below (text adapted from the <a class="reference external" href="http://protocols.humanconnectome.org/HCP/3T/task-fMRI-protocol-details.html">HCP protocol</a>). Before each task, participants were given detailed instructions and examples, as well as a practice run. A session was typically composed either of two repetitions of the HCP localizers, or one resting-state run and one HCP localizer. The eprime scripts for preparation and presentation of the stimuli can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/action/ChooseDownloadResources?project=HCP_Resources&amp;resource=Scripts&amp;filePath=HCP_TFMRI_scripts.zip">HCP database</a>. Stimuli and e-prime scripst were provided by the Human Connectome Project, U-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University. Note that in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cneuromod</span></code> DataLad, functional runs are named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">func_sub-&lt;participant&gt;_ses-&lt;sess&gt;_task-&lt;task&gt;_run-&lt;run&gt;</span></code>, where the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;participant&gt;</span></code> tag includes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sub-01</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sub-06</span></code>.

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gambling</span></code> duration: approximately 3 minutes. Participants were asked to guess whether a hidden number (represented by a “?” during 1500ms) was above or below 5 <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.10.002">(Delgado et al. 2000)</a>. They indicated their choice using a button press, and were then shown the actual number. If they guessed correctly they were told they won money (+$1.00, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win</span></code> trial), if they guessed incorrectly they were told they lost money (-$0.50, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loss</span></code> trial), and if the number was exactly 5 they were told that they neither won or lost money ($0, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">neutral</span></code> trial). Note that no money was actually given to the participants and, as such, this task may not be an accurate reproduction of the HCP protocol. The conditions were presented in blocks of 8 trials of type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reward</span></code> (6 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win</span></code> trials pseudo randomly interleaved with either 1 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">neutral</span></code> and 1 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loss</span></code> trial, 2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">neutral</span></code> trials, or 2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loss</span></code> trials) or of type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">punishment</span></code> (6 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loss</span></code> trials pseudo-randomly interleaved with either 1 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">neutral</span></code> and 1 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win</span></code> trial, 2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">neutral</span></code> trials, or 2 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">win</span></code> trials).

Following each clip, participants were asked to judge whether the objects had a “Mental interaction” (an interaction that appeared as if the shapes were taking into account each other’s feelings and thoughts), whether the were “Not Sure”, or if there was “No interaction”. Button presses were used to record their responses. In each of the two runs, participants viewed 5 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mental</span></code> videos and 5 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code> videos, and had 5 fixation blocks of 15 seconds each.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">relational</span></code> duration: approximately 3 minutes. Participants were shown 6 different shapes filled with 1 of 6 different textures (Smith et al. 2007). There were two conditions: relations processing (event type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">relational</span></code>), and control matching condition (event type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control</span></code>). In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">relational</span></code> events, 2 pairs of objects were presented on the screen, with one pair at the top of the screen, and the other pair at the bottom. Participants were instructed to decide what dimension differed in the top pair (shape or texture), and then decide if the bottom pair differed, or not, on the same dimension (i.e. if the top pair differed in shape, did the bottom pair also differ in shape). Their answers were recorded by one of two button presses: “a” differ on same dimension; “b” don’t differ on same dimension. In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control</span></code> events, participants were shown two objects at the top of the screen, and one object at the bottom of the screen, with a word in the middle of the screen (either “shape” or “texture”).They were told to decide whether the bottom object matched either of the top two objects on that dimension (i.e., if the word is “shape”, did the bottom object have the same shape as either of the top two objects). Participants responded “yes” or “no” using the button box. For the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">relational</span></code> condition, the stimuli were presented for 3500 ms, with a 500 ms ITI, and there were four trials per block. In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control</span></code>condition, stimuli were presented for 2800 ms, with a 400 ms ITI, and there were 5 trials per block. In total there were two runs, each with three <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">relational</span></code> blocks, three <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">control</span></code> blocks and three 16-second fixation blocks.</p>

<p>There are instances of re-scanned segments (due to scan QC fail), these re-scans will be in separate sessions. These should be handled or excluded in analysis requiring continuity of the presentation of the story.</p>

<p>This dataset contains functional data acquired while showing participants episodes of the Friends TV show in English. It includes seasons 1 and 2 for all subjects. Each episode is cut in two segments (a/b) to allow more flexible scanning and give participants opportunities for breaks. There is a small overlap between the segment to allow participants to catch up with the storyline. Both segments of an episode were always shown in the same scanning session to avoid participant forgetting the storyline of the episode. Each episode has a mostly self-contained narrative, such that delays between session should have limited influence of the understanding of the story. The task BIDS entity identifies the season, episode and segments (a/b) as such <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">task-s&lt;eason&gt;e&lt;pisode&gt;[ab]</span></code>.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>A mistake happened when ripping the first season, causing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s01e01</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s01e06</span></code> to be swapped in name and order of presentation. Files were renamed afterward to match external data such as annotations. However the order of presentation remains, slighly disrupting the storyline presented to the participant.</p>
