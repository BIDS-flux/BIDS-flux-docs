# Ethics

The Courtois NeuroMod project has been approved by the institutional research ethics board of the [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'île-de-Montréal](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/propos/services-en-anglais). The CIUSSS is a large governmental health organization, and the core NeuroMod team is based at the Research Centre of the Montreal Geriatric Institute ([CRIUGM](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/en.html)), which is a part of the CIUSSS, and affiliated with the University of Montreal. The ethics documentation may be useful for research teams to receive ethics approval for secondary analysis by their local institutions, if required.
