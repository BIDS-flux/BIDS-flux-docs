Heterogeneous Data
------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^
Heterogeneous data refers to other types of data, such as demographic information, clinical scores, genetic data, and processed MRI data that can be stored in a csv file e.g. volume of a finite number of ROIs. 
This data is not processed because the processed data will be stored in a relational database.

Accessing Heterogeneous Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The heterogeneous data can be accessed through a relational database. 
This database stores the processed data and allows for efficient querying and data retrieval.

Combining with MRI Raw Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The heterogeneous data can be combined with MRI raw data for comprehensive analysis.

Generating and Managing Subject IDs in REDCap
---------------------------------------------

In REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), generating subject IDs for a multi-site study, separating recruitment IDs from consented IDs, and creating family IDs can be managed through a combination of REDCap's built-in features and custom project setup. Here’s a general approach:

Subject ID Generation for Multi-Site Studies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To generate unique subject IDs for a multi-site study, you can use a combination of automated numbering and site-specific prefixes. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

A. Site-Specific Prefixes

- **Site Code:** Assign a unique code or prefix for each site (e.g., SITE1, SITE2).
- **Pre-Generated or Automated Numbering:** Either use a pre-generated list of numbered IDs distributed to each site, or use REDCap’s automated numbering feature to generate a sequential ID for each new record.
- **Concatenation:** Combine the site code with the numbered ID to create a unique subject ID.

**Example:**

- For a participant from Site 1: ``SITE1-001``, ``SITE1-002``
- For a participant from Site 2: ``SITE2-001``, ``SITE2-002``

B. Implementing in REDCap

1. **Create a Field for Site Code:**

   Add a dropdown field (e.g., ``site_code``) to select the site.

2. **Use Auto-Numbering for IDs:**

   Enable auto-numbering in project settings for the record ID field.
   
   **Use a preregistered ID:**
   
   Alternatively, pre-generate a list of subject IDs for each site which is used when creating the records in REDCap.

3. **Create a Calculated Field for Subject ID:**

   Use a calculated field to concatenate the site code with the auto-numbered ID.
   Formula: ``[site_code] + '-' + [record_id]``

Separating Recruitment IDs from Consented IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To manage recruitment and consented IDs separately:

A. Recruitment IDs

- **Recruitment ID:** Create a recruitment ID during the initial contact or pre-screening phase.

B. Consented IDs

- **Consented ID:** Generate a new ID upon obtaining consent, possibly using the site-specific prefix system.

Steps:

1. **Recruitment Phase:**

   Create a separate form for recruitment data with a unique recruitment ID.
   Store preliminary information before consent.

2. **Consented Phase:**

   After obtaining consent, create a new record in the main study database.
   Link recruitment ID to the new consented ID for reference.

Generating Family IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For studies involving parent-child pairs or families:

A. Family ID Field

- **Family ID:** Create a field to assign a unique family ID that can link all family members.

Steps:

1. **Create a Family ID Field:**

   Add a field (e.g., ``family_id``) to assign a family ID.
   Generate this ID manually or using a combination of site code and a sequential number (e.g., ``FAM001``, ``FAM002``).

2. **Linking Family Members:**

   Ensure each family member’s record includes the same family ID to link them.

Implementation in REDCap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example Project Setup:

1. **Create Fields:**

   - ``site_code`` (Dropdown): To select site.
   - ``record_id`` (Auto-Numbering): REDCap’s built-in ID.
   - ``subject_id`` (Calculated): ``[site_code] + '-' + [record_id]``
   - ``recruitment_id`` (Text): Manually entered during recruitment.
   - ``family_id`` (Text): Manually or auto-generated to link family members.

2. **Form Design:**

   - **Recruitment Form:** Collects preliminary data with ``recruitment_id``.
   - **Main Study Form:** Collects detailed data with ``subject_id`` and ``family_id``.

3. **Workflow:**

   - **Recruitment Phase:** Use the recruitment form to gather initial data.
   - **Consent Phase:** Create a new record in the main study form, using ``site_code`` and auto-numbering for ``subject_id``, and include the ``family_id`` for related participants.

This approach ensures unique and traceable IDs for participants across multiple sites, maintains separation between recruitment and consented IDs, and facilitates linking family members in the study.
