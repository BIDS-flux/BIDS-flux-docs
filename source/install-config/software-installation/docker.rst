Docker Installation
=============================

Montreal
+++++++

* Montreal is working with Ubuntu. `Installation of docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>`_
* `Installation of docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/>`_

Calgary
+++++++

* Calgary is working with RedHat. Docker does not have direct packages for installation of RedHat8 with x86_64 arquitecture, thus, we will use the `CentOS installation packages. <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/>`_
* Make sure to also `install docker compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/>`_ since it will be used to install for instance :ref:`StoreSCP. <storescp>`
