## Plethysmograph

Participant’s pulse was measured using a MR-compatible plethysmograph, placed on the ankle or foot to obtain beat-by-beat estimates of heart rate based on the interval between successive systolic peaks.

## Skin conductance
Skin conductance will be measured using two MR-compatible electrodes applied to the sole of the foot. An electrocardiogram will be recorded using three MR-compatible electrodes placed on the participants upper body and will measure the electrical activity generated by the heart. A pneumatic belt will be placed under the participants ribs, to measure their rate of respiration. Measures will be acquired at 1000 Hz using the BIOPAC systems available at l’UNF, and data will be processed in an event-related manner. The changes in heart rate induced in the 10 seconds following the onset of the stimuli will be measured relative to baseline (1 sec pre-stimulus). The skin conductance response will be assessed using the area under the curve (10 sec epoch post-stimulus) of the smoothed (1-sec average) and drift-corrected (1-sec differential) signal. These measures will be collected in during both the fMRI and MEG scans.
