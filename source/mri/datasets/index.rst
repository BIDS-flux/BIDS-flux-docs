Datasets
========

All functional and anatomical data for the C-PIP project has been formatted in [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), for more information visit the Brain Imaging Data Structure documentation [site](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Note that BIDS session names have no meaning apart from being data acquired in the same session. The number of runs, the tasks and their order within each session will not match from one participant to another. Note that a few session indices are skipped if the whole session was discarded for various scanning issues.
